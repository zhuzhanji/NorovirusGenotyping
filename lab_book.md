- scripts/blast_reference_data.py

  This standalone python script downloads all the reference sequences for BLAST analysis from GenBank. All fastas are written into './data/database/refseq.fasta'. The target location could be changed in the script.

2.Preparing Reference Sequences for MSA from GenBank

3.Translation of VP1 gene

4.Making BLAST database

5.Pre-alignment of RdRp partial sequences and VP1 partial sequences

6.BLAST query and genogroup assignment
