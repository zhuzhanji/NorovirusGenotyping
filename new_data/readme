Reference dataset of Chhabra et al 2019 (Supplementary material 1)
NT Sequences automatically downloaded from GenBank
ORF1 and ORF2 extracted based on annotations on GenBank
RdRp/GII/KX354134.1	was deleted because it does not contain ORF1.
RdRp/GII/X76716.1 does not have ORF1 information on Genbank, so it was extracted using virulign. 
Thereâ€™s no F529737 on GenBank, so it is removed from the dataset.

1.A.fasta: nt sequences of norovirus genogroup A
2.A.orf: ORF sequence of the nt sequences in A.fasta
3.A_annotation.csv: ORF coordinates of the nt sequences in A.fasta
4.all.orf: all the ORF sequences from different genogroups
  id format: genogroup|[Ptype  genotype]|genbank accesion number
