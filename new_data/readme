0.rdrp_taxonomy.csv, vp1_taxonomy.csv: reference dataset for BLAST, downloaded from Chhabra et al 2019 (Supplementary material 1)


1.A.fasta: nt sequences of norovirus genogroup A
NT Sequences automatically downloaded from GenBank are under 'reference_sequences_RdRp/' and 'reference_sequences_VP1/'
RdRp/GII/KX354134.1	was deleted from the reference dataset because it does not contain ORF1 region.
RdRp/GII/X76716.1 does not have ORF1 annotation on Genbank, so it was annotated using virulign. 
Thereâ€™s no F529737 on GenBank, so it is removed from the dataset.

2.A.orf: ORF sequence of the nt sequences in A.fasta
ORF1 and ORF2 are extracted based on the annotations of GenBank

3.A_annotation.csv: ORF coordinates of the nt sequences in A.fasta

4.all.orf: all the ORF sequences from different genogroups
  id format: genogroup|[Ptype  genotype]|genbank accesion number
  i.e. >GI|GI.P1|KF039733.1

5.rdrp_taxonomy.csv: References strains for norovirus RdRp P-types

6.vp1__taxonomy.csv: References strains for norovirus VP1 genotypes

7.test_norovirus.fasta: the test dataset, it is too large to be uploaded.

8.results_rivm.csv: typing result of RIVM for the test dataset.

9.test_result_3.csv: typing result(group assignment so far) of my method. Column BLAST contains the assigned groups for respective queries(column query).

10.dataset/refseq_2.fasta: It contains all the reference sequences for BLAST analysis. The blast database was built from it. 

11.dataset/refseq_annotation.csv: It contains all the ORF coordinates for refseq_2.fasta

12.refseqdb_2.*: BLAST database

13.A.aln: alignment of the orf1(or orf2) of genogroup A. It's in CLUSTAL format.

14. all.aln: alignment of orf1(or orf2) of all genogroups. It's in CLUSTAL format.
