Reference dataset of Chhabra et al 2019 (Supplementary material 1)
NT Sequences automatically downloaded from GenBank
ORF1 and ORF2 extracted based on annotations on GenBank
RdRp/GII/KX354134.1	was deleted because it does not contain ORF1.
RdRp/GII/X76716.1 does not have ORF1 information on Genbank, so it was extracted using virulign. 
Thereâ€™s no F529737 on GenBank, so it is removed from the dataset.

1.A.fasta: nt sequences of norovirus genogroup A
2.A.orf: ORF sequence of the nt sequences in A.fasta
3.A_annotation.csv: ORF coordinates of the nt sequences in A.fasta
4.all.orf: all the ORF sequences from different genogroups
  id format: genogroup|[Ptype  genotype]|genbank accesion number
  (caution: vp1/all.orf contains only genbank accesion number, which is to be corrected)
5.rdrp_taxonomy.csv: References strains for norovirus RdRp P-types
6.vp1__taxonomy.csv: References strains for norovirus VP1 genotypes

7.test_norovirus.fasta is the test dataset, it is too large to be uploaded.
results_rivm.csv is the typing result of RIVM for the test dataset.
test_result_3.csv is the typing(grouping assignment sofar) of my method. The column BLAST contains the assigned groups for respective queries(column query).
